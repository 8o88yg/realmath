Math Thesis: Reality can be summarized by the (Fast/Neutral/Slow) Fourier Transform, an arbitrary number in any theory, an arbitrary prime or natural integer, 0 at an arbitrary precision, and a set of sets around the empty set. I've also defined private empty set primitives not yet introduced in Standard Set Theory. In fact,if you are mathematically mature, you realize that any mathematical formulation can be edited without changing its integrity to represent the past, this moment, and the future. In fact, even if treating reality as a continous set of frames (maybe we can say sampled constantly), we are dealing with an infinite binary number which can be traced as an infinite numnber. The point is, however, that math can be manipulated heavily so it takes particular skill to represent reality accurately with math. There is much more to say and draw with CAD for clarity, but for now just let us focus on playing basketball and leveraging the archimedes exhaustion method. Countable and uncountable infinites are the same. Just use a multidimensional chart to track the counts, and treat the decimal as an extra digit in the number system or as a random variable of integer value. Keep in mind that infinite dimensions can be represented in 0D,1D,2D (infinite angles on circle can be denoted as orthogonal),3D,4D,5D...,ND where N approaches infinity along with -(N-1)D,-(N-2)D,-(N-3)D,...-3D,-2D,-1D. Math can describe anything useful, nothing useful, nothing useless, anything useless. Math is easy and it doesn't take much to be mathematically mature. 

Embarrasing no_longer_Propietary info below.

Semi-codes:
Breathing accurately and controlling circulation, invoking C pointers, understanding entropy atmospherically, and being stationarily dynamic with the unit point(s) are more important.

Proprietary Codes:
1- FFFF
2- FuFu: 0, FuI: 1, FuG: 1, IFu: 1, II: 1, IG: 1, GFu: 1, GI: 1, GG: 1

Miscellaneous:
Me2Me: I miss slang and idk if ima change the UI color yet.

Stationary: Book, Script
Dynamic: Work, VideoGame
Neutral: revised set theory with the empty set primitives I've defined

Medicine: avoid the primitive virus at all costs

Economics: Crypto is to drugs as VISA is to food. Photosynthesis is the fundamental currency perhaps.
